## Overview 📝

This project focuses on creating a basic fighting game using JavaScript. The game includes player classes, game simulation, health tracking, and interactive controls. Explore JavaScript fundamentals such as classes, functions, DOM manipulation, event listeners, and conditional statements while building this project.

## Key Features ✨

- **Player Interaction:** Players can control their characters with interactive buttons for attacking and healing.
- **Dynamic Health Display:** The game dynamically updates and displays player health during the match.
- **Winner Declaration:** The game declares a winner when one of the players' health reaches zero.
- **Sound Effects:** Enjoy victory sounds and attack/heal sounds during gameplay.
- **Reset Option:** Reset the game and health to start a new match.

## Tech Stack 💻

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Replit
- Visual Studio Code

## Concepts Explored 🛠️

- **Classes:** Creation of Player and Game classes for organizing code and maintaining game state.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Updating the Document Object Model to reflect the current state of the game.
- **Event Listeners:** Capturing keyboard events for player controls and button clicks for game actions.
- **Conditional Statements:** Implementing logic to check for game over conditions and declare a winner.
- **Random Number Generation:** Using `Math.random()` to simulate random attacks and healing.

## How to Play 🎮

1. Press `Q` to make Player 1 attack or `A` to heal.
2. Press `P` to make Player 2 attack or `L` to heal.
3. Observe health updates after each action.
4. Hear victory sounds when a player wins.
5. Click the "Simulate" button to get a random winner.
6. Click the "Reset" button to start a new match.

## Code Structure 🧱

The JavaScript code is organized into Player and Game classes, ensuring a modular and structured approach. Event listeners handle both keyboard inputs and button clicks, triggering the necessary actions in the game.
